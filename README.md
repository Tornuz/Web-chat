# Web-chat (https://web-chatting.herokuapp.com)

A Web app designed using Web sockets in node.js.

Just open the browser...Add the url.. Login... Start chatting...

The message you send will go along with your login username , time , date...

If multiple people are using it then you can send private messages also by just using  "@" and then typing name of the user. This will send message to that user only. Sounds nice na!!
